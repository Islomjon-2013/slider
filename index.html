              The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous
              mammal.[1][2] It is the only domesticated species in the family
              Felidae and is commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house
              cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.[4] Cats
              are commonly kept as house pets, but can also be farm cats or
              feral cats; the feral cat ranges freely and avoids human
              contact.[5] Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship
              and their ability to kill rodents. About 60 cat breeds are
              recognized by various cat registries.[6]

              Horse breeds are loosely divided into three categories based on
              general temperament: spirited "hot bloods" with speed and
              endurance; "cold bloods", such as draft horses and some ponies,
              suitable for slow, heavy work; and "warmbloods", developed from
              crosses between hot bloods and cold bloods, often focusing on
              creating breeds for specific riding purposes, particularly in
              Europe. There are more than 300 breeds of horse in the world
              today, developed for many different uses.

              Birds come in a huge range of colours. These colours can be useful
              to a bird in two ways. Camouflage colours help to hide the bird,
              and bright colours identify the bird to others of the same
              species. Often the male is brightly coloured while the female is
              camouflaged. The logic is as follows: the female carries the
